## 🚀 Featured Projects

- 🔬 **Lung Cancer Risk Prediction using Explainable AI**  
  Built classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) with SHAP & LIME interpretability layers to understand lung cancer risk prediction.
  
- 🏦 **Apartment Selection Decision Analysis**  
  Built a process of selecting the best apartment based on a number of priorities using different decision analysis formulas in Excel. 

- 📉 **Used Cars EDA & Visualization**  
  Used PowerBi to better understand the used car market in Dubai. (This was done to detect any potential for a benefits in entering the market for a automotive industry that was being studied as a case study).

- 🚁 **Implemeting Machine Learning Algorithms for Detecting Covid-19**  
  Used pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), EfficientNet, InceptionV3, MobileNetV3 and VGG19 to accurately detect the difference between a patient who has Covid-19 and one who does not through chest X-ray images.
